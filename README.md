# A brief introduction to this repository

The task at hand is to generate a complex geometry having 20-30 vertices using We-
bGL. The environment has two light sources, one directional light and one spotlight.
Moreover, the object having the complex geometry is coupled with per fragment
shading along with a texture. A varying view volume and a perspective projection
is applied.
Figure below shows the implementation of the above concepts in stages. The final
effect is depicted in Figure (1c) which shows effect on object of the texture image
combined with cartoon shading as well as directional and spotlight with a cutoff
angle 45 â—¦ and a non-linear attenuation.
